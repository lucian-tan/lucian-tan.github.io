            Clients were complaining about the slow completion time of some of their custom data requests, which could put subscription renewals at risk. Through collaborations with internal stakeholders, we changed operation processes with a new internal tool to improve production efficiency and enable feed management. We also improved the web application for a better user experience. These changes resulted in faster request completion time, happier staff, and increased customer satisfaction with the service.

          <p>
            Second Measure, an alternative data broker, provides a web platform for their clients to obtain proprietary data for research purposes. These clients that subscribe to the service, usually data and financial analysts from investment and business strategy teams, use the data to produce business reports that support their theses.
          </p>
          <p>
            For clients with custom files included in their contracts, they can request for bespoke data sets if they are unable to obtain the data from the web application, which is updated daily with various analyses of U.S consumer transactions.

          </p>
          <p>
            For internal management purposes, a <b>graphic interface did not exist</b> for the management of these custom files, as data scientists and software engineers manipulated the files directly in code. Client support and engagement teams had to access client accounts if they wanted to get details of the files.

            Some clients left feedback to express their disappointment with some of their data requests, which were <b>taking a much longer time than expected to be completed</b>, sometimes even weeks after their first correspondence. 
          </p>
          <p>
            This situation was placing the company's reputation as a reliable provider, and putting future subscription renewals at risk. Thus, my team was involved in this service to investigate and propose a solution to this problem.

          <h2>Learn, design, validate</h2>
          <p>
            Stakeholder research was first conducted to get a comprehensive understanding of the problem. Due to restrictive company policies, user research was conducted with client support and engagement teams in place of clients.
          </p>
          <p> 
            The internal stakeholders (client-facing teams, data scientists, and software engineers) were deeply involved in this collaborative design effort. Design iterations were completed through multiple meetings to gather feedback, confirm the product specifications, and obtain approval before development.

          <p>
            Through on-site discussions at San Mateo and video-conferences with stakeholders based in New York City, I gained an outline of their process. These client-facing staff include client engagement, client support, and data science teams.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="col">
          <h2>The original process</h2>

            When a client makes a request for a custom data set, this happens:

          <ol>
            <li>
              <b>Clarifying the request</b><br>
              When a custom data request is made, the client engagement (or client support staff) will attempt to understand the clientâ€™s intentions via a phone call or email correspondence. This is to help the client choose the most relevant data for their needs. Data scientists are sometimes roped in to provide their expertise during these discussions.
              
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Creating the task</b><br>
              When the specifications are clear, the client-facing staff writes them down into a task that will be added to the data science teamâ€™s job queue.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Completing the task</b><br>
              A data scientist will pick up the task and set up the file (or feed) for the client's account based on the specifications. When that is complete, they will inform the client support staff.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Informing the subscriber</b><br>
              The client support staff checks the contents of the file/feed to make sure it is set up correctly, and then will update the client via an email message.

          <h3>Pinpointing the problem</h3>
          <p>
            While this process is applied for all request types, the clients are informed that requests that are more complicated will require more time. The problem that initiated the project lies only with the 'simpler' requests, which were explained to be <b>easy to resolve, yet delivered later than expected</b>. This also included minor change requests to existing data feeds.

          <h3>The bottleneck at the data science team</h3>
          <p>
            The reason for the delayed completion of some requests was the backlog of tasks that the data science team has. With the oldest tasks prioritised in the job queue, simple requests that might need only a few minutes to complete could be held up by other tasks for days, or even weeks.
          </p>

          <h3>Interactions with clients are essential</h3>
          <p>
            From their past experiences with clients, the client-facing staff noted that the initial conversations about the requests are crucial to determine the right data set for the client. This phase is an opportunity for them to share and impress clients with their industry knowledge, which clients have frequently cited as a highlight that influenced their subscription renewal decisions.
          </p>

          <h3>Expected growth in requests / development of ideas</h3>
          <p>As the company expands the range of available analyses over time, the client-facing team expects the number of custom requests to increase with the growth. The solution needs to be scalable and flexible to the needs of the product growth, and help to reduce the man-hours to complete a request.

            <li>

            We held discussions with the stakeholders on concepts I proposed and suggestions from other stakeholders, which we evaluated against the requirements of the project and our current capabilities.
          </p>
          <p>
            We agreed on branching out a new process from the original that shifts the responsibility of setting up â€˜simpleâ€™ files from data scientists to the client-facing staff. This change relies on existing infrastructure, and shifts the responsibility of setting up those files from the data science team to the client-facing staff. Client-facing staff would use this new internal tool to create and modify simple feeds, cutting out the inefficient waiting time that happened previously.

          <p>
            After the teams started using the feature, the <b>average time taken from task creation to resolution was reduced</b> for simple requests. Client-facing staff noted that they stopped receiving negative feedback regarding service tardiness from clients.
          </p><p>
            The product team was also happy to gain a tool to have an overview of all the custom feed trends more easily. More analyses were eventually added to expand the capabilities of file production.

          <h3>Keep stakeholders involved throughout the process</h3>
          <p>
            Keeping a close communication with the stakeholders made it easy to shape the product according to their needs. Having their support during the design process enabled us to modify operational procedures and cut down developmental effort to deliver the intended results.
          </p>
          <h3>Start small and work with feedback</h3>
          <p>
            Some of our lofty early concepts had to be scrapped because of requirements and deadlines. However, releasing a solution swiftly provided opportunities to learn more about client behaviour at a lower cost, helping to inform our next steps for the product.
