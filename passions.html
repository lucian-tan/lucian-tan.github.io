          <p>
            The feedback collected from users during the test phase were negative: the experience did not match the promise of a social network for discussion and sharing of things they were passionate about. With extensive user research and testing, my design team compiled and shared user insights to company stakeholders, using them to make informed design decisions. We worked closely with production stakeholders to prioritise features in order to gradually deliver a satisfying, passion-driven app experience.</p>

          <p>
            The social network, only available as a mobile app, is centred on creating communities for people to share and discuss about topics they are passionate about. Users can share stories in various formats, discuss via comments, and message befriended users. The social network promised to eschew advertisements and create an internal economy based on collaborations and sponsorship.

The recruitment of the testers for user research is also influenced by this definition.

        </p>
        <p>
          Testers noted that this meant that <b>the current experience did not match the company's proposition</b> of an engaging space to discover or deep-dive into specific passions, which is a big concern.

          </p>
          <p>
            Through these discussions, we identified 3 domains the team needs to work on to deliver a complete experience. In this story, most of the work done occurs under the 'personalisation' domain.

Key interactions to achieve include <b class="accent">connecting people to the right communities</b> based on their common passions, <b class="accent">introducing new passions</b> to users, and <b class="accent">fostering friendships</b> on the social network.
          </p>
          <p>A secondary objective was to provide user insights to other teams (such as content creation teams) to supplement their own research for their roadmap planning.</p>

            When real users were unavailable during the 'internal access' phase, we used <a href="https://www.usertesting.com/" target="_blank">UserTesting</a> to source testers that match our target user and gain insights from them. The tests from this phase were designed to provide insights on users that have never been on the app before, and were hence focused on the new user onboarding experience.</p>
