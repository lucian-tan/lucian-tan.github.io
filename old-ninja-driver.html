            The couriers at Ninja Van, a last-mile logistics company, use an Android application to obtain and complete their daily delivery tasks, and limitations within the original application were causing operational issues for the business. Through collaborations with various teams, the app was re-designed to eliminate erroneous workflows and accommodate more operational procedures. This resulted in fewer operational issues, faster re-training, and a better foundation for future business requirements.

          <h2>Reaching a new market segment</h2>
          <p>
            Ninja Van, a B2B last-mile logistics company in Southeast Asia, wanted to introduce a B2C on-demand pick-up & delivery service in Jakarta to reach new segments in the social commerce market and establish a stronger brand presence in Indonesia.
          </p>
          <p> 
            After the initial plan to integrate social media platforms with an order creation feature fell apart, the company quickly shifted the focus to on-demand logistics services for smaller-scale e-commerce sellers. When the online application launched in 2017 to a tepid response, my team was assigned to improve the user experience of this product.

            The original concept was a logistics and cash payment service for small, e-commerce business owners to sell and deliver to their customers via their social media platforms. When the plan for a social platform listing feature fell apart, that feature was removed from the released product.
          </p>
          <p>The feature set of the application includes:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Requesting for parcel pick up at their desired location</li>
            <li>Checking delivery prices on the application</li>

            In the first few months after the publicised launch of the service, the adoption rate was poor with a high drop-off rate. Observing the usage analytics, we noticed that the drop-off happens mainly at these points:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>On the page where the user sets their pick up location</li>
            <li>On the page where the user enters the parcel details</li>
            <li>On the dashboard after the user completes entering parcel information, but chooses not to request for a courier</li>

            When participants were setting up their pickup location, they were <b>confused to receive incorrect place names</b> on the map. This problem with the map API (due to coverage issues in Indonesia) also made it difficult for them to search for their locations accurately. We learnt that this issue was <b>leaving poor impressions at the start</b> of their experience.

          <p>
            To make some of our ideas work, we needed to tap on the operational capabilities of the company. The product team discussed with the Indonesian operations team to find out what we could introduce without affecting other operating procedures adversely.

            As this product has much lower volumes than the core routine operations, we were able to devise a new process that enables a less taxing user experience on the application.  By having our operational staff <b>digitise the parcel information on behalf of the customer</b>, we could unlock different user flows that deliver <b>a more convenient experience without complicating our existing procedures</b>.

          <p>
            While we considered alternative touchpoints to make the fees more discoverable, we decided that it was best to keep it within the application so as to direct traffic to the application. 
            We realised that the layout of the form was making participants enter more details than required to receive the information they need, extending their interaction time unnecessarily. We re-arranged the form inputs, so that customers can clearly see updated prices with every input change, and decide if they want to continue.

          <p>After the design updates were released, we noticed a small uptick to the number of requests, though the weekly numbers were still low. A good indicator was that <b>new users spent less screen time at each screen before progressing to the next</b>. The increased traffic to the website and application could have been influenced by other factors, such as more effective marketing campaigns later on.

          <h3>Consider both the foreground and the background</h3>
          <p>
            We would not be able to introduce a dramatic change like enabling no-input parcel pick up, if not for the Indonesian operating team collaborating to make it possible operationally. While the initial cost of this change was high, the investment paid off by enabling other new products and services.
          </p>
          <h3>Don't make assumptions of user behaviour</h3>
          <p>
            The discovery of what our target users in Indonesia expected in the sign-up process was an eye-opener for our team. It was a good reminder that our beliefs and expectations are not universal, and that extra effort should be taken to fully understand the target users when creating a product.
          </p>
          <h3>Organise UX writing well for translations</h3>
          <p>
            Building a product in one language with plans to release it in another requires more care to ensure that the intended messaging is not lost in translation. We used a spreadsheet to consolidate all the descriptions and labels, serving as a ‘source of truth’ for our collaborations with other departments, and to maintain a consistent tone throughout the user experience.
